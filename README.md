# Portfolio: LA1300

## Introduction and Goals
In our Project we coded a Vocabulary trainer. In this small program, you will be prompted with English vocabulary words that are stored externally by the program in a ".csv" file.

**My goals in this project were:**
- To explain how Arrays are working.
- To show you the advantages and disadvantages of Arrays.

## How do Arrays work?
First I want you to give you a short explanation of what Arrays are. Arrays are data containers in which you can store values. For example, strings or integers. However, you must first tell them what data type they are and how big they are.

**How to create create Arrays:** <br>

The basic structure of an array is always the same.
```cs
int[] arrayName = new int[5]
```

You must first specify the data type as in a variable. After the data type, however, square brackets must be added. Then, as always, you can freely choose a name. After the equal sign you have to write ``new int[5]``. In the square brackets you have to enter the number of places the array should have. 


There are different ways you can fill them. The one which I use the most is this:
```cs
int[] arrayName = new int[5]

arrayName[1] = 4;
```
**Attention:** <br>
An Arrays first place is 0 not 1. In the example I fill the 2 digit with 4 not the first.

## Advanteges and Disadvangates

**Advantages:** <br>
- They are easy to create and use.
- You can only save one data type in it. (In some times you can be happy that you can only store one type of data in it)

**Disadvantages:** <br>
- Arrays have a fix size. Once created you can't change the size so easy.
- You can only save one data type in it.

## Verification and Suggestions for improvement
Goal 1: You can see an Array on the image and in the code blocks in the first section.

Goal 2: I have listet some points in the second section.

When I started coding one of my sticking points were arrays. It was difficult to understand for me and I want to reach with this portfolio that others can learn something.
